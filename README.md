# MovieLens

The MovieLens Dataset is widely used to build movie recommendation systems with the goal of predicting user movie ratings based on other user's ratings.  The dataset used for this project is the 10M version which is a small subset of the much larger MovieLens Dataset that contains millions of ratings.
